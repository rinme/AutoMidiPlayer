A MIDI to key player for in-game instruments made using C# and WPF with Windows Mica design. This project is originally forked from **[sabihoshi/GenshinLyreMidiPlayer][GenshinLyreMidiPlayer]** and was later detached into its own repository to enable multi-game support and introduce features that don’t fit the original Genshin Impact–only use design.

> If you get a SmartScreen popup, click on "More info" and then "Run anyway"
> The reason this appears is because the application is not signed. Signing costs money which can get very expensive.

## About

### What are MIDI files?
MIDI files (.mid) is a set of instructions that play various instruments on what are called tracks. You can enable specific tracks that you want it to play. It converts the notes on the track into keyboard inputs for the game. Currently it is tuned to C major.

### Can this get me banned?
The short answer is that it's uncertain. Use it at your own risk. Do not play songs that will spam the keyboard, listen to the MIDI file first and make sure to play only one instrument so that the tool doesn't spam keyboard inputs.
* For Genshin Impact, here is [miHoYo's response](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/5763) to using 3rd party tools.
* For Heartopia, here is their [Official Discord message](https://discord.com/channels/1128257488375005215/1460985755529773301/1465702188700405986) about using 3rd party tools.
* For Roblox, use at your own discretion. Different games may have different policies.

### Roblox Piano Support
AutoMidiPlayer now supports Roblox virtual pianos using the MIRP (MIDI Input to Roblox Piano) layout. This provides:
* **61-note chromatic piano** (C2 to C7, MIDI notes 36-96)
* **Automatic character mapping** with Shift key handling
* **Compatible with MIRP layout files** (.mlf format)
* See [ROBLOX_KEYMAP.md](ROBLOX_KEYMAP.md) for detailed documentation
